Perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.  This watcher is based on [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify), and it transforms React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with [Reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify).
